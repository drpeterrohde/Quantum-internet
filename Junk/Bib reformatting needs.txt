search between 'author={...}'

divide string into substrings that were separated by 'and'

for each substring, anything after a ',' gets reduced to an initial with '.' after
if no ',' is present, all substrings except the last one get reduced similarly
do not reduce a name if it already terminates with a '.'

preserve hypenation. e.g Kahir-Kehan -> K.-K.
