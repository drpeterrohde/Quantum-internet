# LaTeX document class for Quantum

`quantumarticle` is the document class for typsetting articles in Quantum.

## Installing `{quantumarticle}`

The `quantumarticle` class is provided with install scripts for bash and PowerShell. These scripts should work for Windows 7 or later with MiKTeX, or for TeX Live with Linux or macOS / OS X. To install the class into your user-local LaTeX directory from within bash:

```bash
$ cd quantum-journal/
$ ./install.sh
```

Similarly, under PowerShell:

```powershell
PS > cd quantum-journal/
PS > ./install.ps1
```

To manually install ``{quantumarticle}``, copy ``quantumarticle.cls`` to ``texmf/tex/latex/quantumarticle`` within your home directory (``~`` under Linux and macOS / OS X, or typically ``C:\Users\``*``your username``*) under Windows) and run ``texhash`` (TeX Live) or ``initexmf --update-fndb`` (MiKTeX).

To test that the installation completed successfull, copy ``quantum-template.tex`` to another directory and compile it as normal.

## Usage

To use it, download the latest version of `quantumarticle.cls` from above and put it into the same folder as your main LaTeX source file.
Then, simply change the document class to `quantumarticle` in the preamble of your document.

    \documentclass[your options]{quantumarticle}

## Compatibility

The `quantumarticle` class tries to be **maximally compatible** with existing document classes, such as, `article`, `revtex`, `iopart`, and `elsarticle`. It supports all standard options, like `twocolumn`, `onecolumn`, `titlepage`, as well as the standard syntax for defining the title page with the `\author`, `\address`, and `\affiliation` commands and the `abstract` environment.

If you encouter any problems, please write an email including a minimal working example that illustrates the problem to quantumarticle@quantum-journal.org
