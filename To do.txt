are there any numerical simulations of network performance for:
	Different topologies
	Different strategies
	Different cost metrics

TCP->OSI

CV encoding of quantum information
	teleportation
	QKD
	QC

implications for scientific research - outsource experiments and hide them

generalise leverage argument to arbitrary comp. power function f and derive qubit leverage from this. in what regimes do we benefit from networking? super-linear??

secrecy of quantum experiment conducted by academics, not just computation

Any other encryption protocols worth discussing?

quantum economic leverage provides profit incentive to voluntarily contribute quantum computational resources to the global network, to the benefit of all users, including themselves.

update statement of contributions - everyone should be there, anyone shouldn’t?
	remove Sam Marks from statement of contributions??

in ‘random number generation’ talk about private key generation

owing to the fundamentally different scaling characteristics of the computational power of networked quantum computers compared to classical ones, economic models for their use are entirely different. we construct pricing models for the licensing of networked quantum computational resources, and discuss their economic implications.

economics
	return on investment
	forward derivatives
	pricing model for time-sharing
	different functions for scaling of computational power

interesting strategic implications: china and US better of combining forces, even though they are competing against each other and combining forces will strengthen the other

latest version of revtex 

latest version of qcircuit

abstract is shit - make awesomeness

3-level gradient echo memory

fig for crossover point for singularity

quantum stockmarket - better to sell qubits to international market and license time-chunks from the global network, than to use your own resources in isolation. - emerge of compute time as a traceable commodity

new results for phase-key encoding

enable coffee stains

remove redundant colour commands for authors

double check all algs

‘single photon’ vs ‘single-photon’ - make consistent

add E91 algorithm

Unnecessary ’s. e.g LAN’s -> LANs etc.

add trace distance as metric
	how does it work for processes rather than states?

in quantum reps/ent dist, discuss:
	architectures
	resource scaling
	different strategies
	error propagation and scaling - how do errors prop. under ent. swapping?
	single photon Bell pairs
	CV entangled states
		tradeoff between loss and dephasing
			large coherent amplitude = easier to detect, but more dephasing
			small coherent amplitude = harder to detect, easier to lose, less dephasing
	trust issues
	any other advantages to repeater networks that i haven’t mentioned
	anything beyond Bell-pairs?

\cite{bib:DurBriegel999}

put QST and QPT into boxes

make sure all abbreviations are introduced the first time they are used
full names are not used once abbreviations are introduced

remove lines from equations where there’s just a number - shift the number up

composition of squeezing operator

is classical blind computing possible? if so, review protocol

add fidelity and purity as cost metrics - how to convert?

put one-time-pad into box

channel capacities (marco tomamichel??)

quantum dot sources/detectors

any more figures to add?

any more circuits to add?

Quantum torrents???!

Consistency of ‘…’ and \emph{…}

Add description of physical layer in stack

Full spellcheck in AU English

Add DOIs

Add arXiv refs

Optical routers and switches - how are they constructed? EOM’s, AOM’s etc

Cross check for duplicate bib entries
