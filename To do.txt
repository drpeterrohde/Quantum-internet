Photon loss in the context of non-post-selected boson-sampling has also been considered \cite{bib:RohdeErrBS12, bib:ScottLost16}.

use graph exploration algs to discover distant nodes to interrogate about their local part of the network

Global requires ledger of state of entire network. Local requires nearest-neighbour communication. Can propagate outwards as a BFS.

For NOON state, loss of single photon causes complete wave function collapse since it reveals full which-path information
