Entanglement ultimate resource: superdense coding

All figures should be [!htb]

Latin awesomeness

The quantum singularity

Enable coffee

Plots for economic models

Resolve bibtex warnings

Resolve latex warnings

Network growth size should be \approx not =

In index, consistent use of singular and plural terms

Forward contract in time-share, not just asset

Move derivations to before definitions such that def only contains final outcome and rest is in body

Separate numbering of tables and algs 

If different users have different scaling functions, how does this affect the relative amount they are willing to pay for time shares? Stockmarket? 
	
Economics essay:
	our futures market and pricing model will provide a platform for increased liquidity and competition, yielding better efficiency outcomes for all.

Consistency of hyphenation: wave-packet wavepacket etc

Quantum radar

Experimental summary of boson-sampling experiments.

Mathematical symbols in algs & tables

Defs for qubit cost and growth, add first line in def

Chronological ordering of things
	e.g cluster state prep in protocols section -> reverse lookup to intro section

Parity projection IS partial bell meas.

Double CNOTs in 3 quit code are wrong - invert to NOT-controls

In algs change ‘in’ with ‘\in’

Add definitions
	route cost
	network cost

Why is roi asymptote to 1 instead of higher?

Index
	digital assets

Use [] symbol in algs for arrays

Use \sc for header fields in algs

Consistent bell-pair and bell pair

Consistent use of italics/$$ in alg boxes

Add paragraphs

Add Bill Munro LOQC stuff -> pillage from BS review

Make index refs single or multipage. Make consistent. Just first appearance of term, or all pages following in section?

Fix link to Nielsen CS papers

Explain KLM CZ operation of NS gates

Discussion on fusion gates and HOM, much better for uqc than klm

What is the relation between P_guess and tr_dist? Include in encryption section.

Strengthen motivation at beginning of each section. How does this fit in with the big picture of the quantum internet?

What happens with costs/attributes when we do purification?

Single-photon vs single photon
Single-qubit vs single quit
Single-anything else

Formatting (upon completion):
	figure locations/sizes to make everything flow

CV encoding of quantum information
	teleportation
	QKD
	QC

Relativistic effects in satellites (Dowling, Byrnes)

Add index{} to
	all figures
	all equations
	all tables
	all algorithms
	multi-page indexes

Numbering of tables: reset counters appropriately

Check index for duplicates
Be consistent in use of singular and plural in index

Information
	bits lost = bits - mutual information
	multiple channels:
		upper bound on bits lost is given by sum
		lower bound given by maximum number of bits lost, maximised over all channels

Economics: Remove ideas and suggestions

Talk about strategic adversaries (governments or companies) competing for computational power. They are both better of uniting resources, and homo/BQC mitigates the security concerns.

Distributed clusters
	use EO between logical qubits
	use server to distribute Bell pairs and ent. Swap.

Discuss other cluster state preparation strategies
	Ladder
	Simon Benjamin schemes
	Just in time preparation (Kok)

Is thermal state dephased coherent state?

Any results out there on performance of different strategies?

Statement of contributions
	List all authors
	Remove non-authors

Brackets around Eq numbers

Define coherence length
	and what’s the other one?

Modularised QC:
	either A sends qubit to B, performs fusion
	C sends Bell pair to A and B, perform fusion, swap entanglement, teleports CZ gate onto neighbours

Indexing:
	complete
	any ‘sees’?
	new sections
	remove duplicates

Bibliography:
	remove duplicates
	complete referencing (ask all authors)

Explain how NS gates make CZ gate work -> MZ interference, 2-photon component only undergoes phase-shift

how to model entanglement purification as a cost/attribute in the graph
	negative costs
	but consumes states
	what graph algorithms accommodate this?

Quantum supremacy: update boson-sampling extrapolation, or shift to another model, e.g universal

outsourced QC -> outsourced QIP protocols
	outsourced quantum experiments

Squeezing operator is defined in multiple places

Hybrid schemes particularly well suited to distributed model

Li, Benjamin - 1204.0443

Chronologically order histories in tables

Section: certificates for user identification

how to decide how to split up quantum data across packets
	we treat packets monolitically
	how do we choose what part of a message goes into what packet?

Any other encryption protocols worth discussing?

quantum economic leverage provides profit incentive to voluntarily contribute quantum computational resources to the global network, to the benefit of all users, including themselves.

update statement of contributions - everyone should be there, anyone shouldn’t?
	remove Sam Marks from statement of contributions??

in ‘random number generation’
	talk about private key generation
	exception: don’t really want to outsource this since it needs to be kept private

owing to the fundamentally different scaling characteristics of the computational power of networked quantum computers compared to classical ones, economic models for their use are entirely different. we construct pricing models for the licensing of networked quantum computational resources, and discuss their economic implications.

Coffee stains
	enable
	Align with trump box

remove redundant colour commands for authors

double check all algs

add E91 algorithm in box

add trace distance as metric
	how does it work for processes rather than states?

in quantum reps/ent dist, discuss:
	architectures
	resource scaling
	different strategies
	error propagation and scaling - how do errors prop. under ent. swapping?
	single photon Bell pairs
	CV entangled states
		tradeoff between loss and dephasing
			large coherent amplitude = easier to detect, but more dephasing
			small coherent amplitude = harder to detect, easier to lose, less dephasing
	trust issues
	any other advantages to repeater networks that i haven’t mentioned
	anything beyond Bell-pairs?
