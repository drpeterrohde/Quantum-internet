computational multiplier of time-sharing compared to isolation

How does multiplier change over time when a user makes no further investment. i.e time-share reduces, but computational multiplier still increases.

Economics or quantum mind:

	Creative-destruction of jobs

	Industrial revolution: many jobs (hammer and sickle) made obsolete

	But new, more highly skilled jobs emerged in the process

	Might anticipate something similar will happen in the era of post-human machine learning

	What will be the new jobs that are created? What can replace highly-skilled jobs? What will humans do? Will this be the end of human-centric productivity? Will our capitalist economic model become redundant?

Economics
	Risk/return tradeoffs.
	Market capitalisation of vendors of quantum hardware. This includes both manufacturers/sellers and also licensors of hardware (ask Sam Marks).
	Observation: only those hardware owners who unite with the global network will benefit from its leverage. Those who choose not to participate in the global network will be priced out of the market via exponentially higher cost per FLOP (assuming all other costs are equal).
	From our understanding of quantum stock-market dynamics, can we construct derivative markets? e.g futures, get/put options etc etc etc on units of compute time. A Quantum Black-Scholes perhaps?
	what about inefficient markets?
	suppose we assume a profit margin rather than zero profit efficiency assumption?



\section{The end of the digital revolution}
	* replacement of digital technology. QC is universal for classical comp. When qubits become as cheap as classical bits, classical computers will become redundant and we expect a full transition of the digital economy to quantum architectures.

Singularity - subsections
	* self improvement via optimisation of network resource allocation
	* self improvement of hardware architectures via IC layout algorithms being NP-complete
	* in end-of-digital-revolution world, most end-user applications will be classical not quantum. The excess unused quantum resources held by users the world over, will then be contributed to the network, ushering in unprecedented growth in the scale and computational leverage of the network.
	* machine learning - discovery of new algorithms, applications and architectures, self-improvement.

QKD

%The main drawback is thus the ability to perform long-distance transmission of photons. Current QKD networks have been limited to relatively small distances, on the order of $\sim100$km, including in Austria, Switzerland, Japan, USA, and China \cite{bib:lo2014secure}. The longest distance QKD network that is currently planned is the Beijing to Shanghai QKD link, spanning a distance of $\sim2,000$km. This involves 32 trusted nodes\index{Trusted nodes} to break the full route into shorter segments.

%Utilising space communications for the purpose of QKD has been discussed in several works \cite{bib:hughes2000quantum, bib:rarity2002ground, bib:pfennigbauer2003free, bib:aspelmeyer2003long, bib:armengol08}. As already demonstrated in space-based entanglement experiments \cite{bib:yin2017satellite, bib:ren2017ground, bib:liao2017satellite} far lower attenuation rates are possible than ground-only approaches. Since cryptography schemes such as BB84\index{BB84 protocol} do not require entanglement, these would appear to be the first widespread commercial application for quantum technologies.  

%The ready realisability of space based QKD was already noted in a variety of configurations including ground-to-space\index{Ground-to-space communication} and space-to-ground\index{Space-to-ground communication} quantum communication \cite{bib:rarity2002ground, bib:aspelmeyer2003long}. In the context of security, the first long-distance experiments that are likely to be demonstrated will employ trusted nodes\index{Trusted nodes}. For example, after performing QKD between satellite\index{Satellites} and ground stations\index{Ground stations}, a satellite could store the key for some time in a quantum memory\index{Quantum memory} until another QKD can be performed to another ground station using a one-time pad\index{One-time pad cipher} \cite{bib:liao2017satellite}. These types of experiments are currently planned to eventually facilitate intercontinental QKD\index{Intercontinental QKD} between China and Austria.  

%QKD has been widely experimentally demonstrated over long distances \cite{bib:Muller96}, and unlike quantum computing, QKD is at the stage of commercial viability. Thus, a quantum internet with low cost metrics would already find substantial utility with today's technology. Currently, great progress in being made in the implementation of QKD in fibre \cite{???}, over free-space \cite{bib:Buttler00}, and even over intercontinental satellite uplinks \cite{JWP}. It seems extremely likely that some government agencies would be rolling out QKD systems \cite{bib:Secret}, especially in light of the paranoia surrounding quantum codebreaking.
