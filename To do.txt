Any other types of switches than MZ ones?
	Mechanical
	Classical fibre-optic switches

Quantum radar

Explain KLM CZ operation of NS gates

Spectral filtering
	cost = entire spectrum
	cost metric, convert to dB
	interpreted as combination of loss and mode-mismatch. Probability of loss + if not lost then different spectral distribution
	could merge with loss metric, replace loss with flat spectral filtering

Discussion on fusion gates and HOM, much better for uqc than klm

Outsourced quantum experiments (by scientists)

What is the relation between P_guess and tr_dist? Include in encryption section.

Strengthen motivation at beginning of each section. How does this fit in with the big picture of the quantum internet?

What happens with costs/attributes when we do purification?

are there any numerical simulations of network performance for:
	Different topologies
	Different strategies
	Different cost metrics

Single-photon vs single photon

Formatting (upon completion):
	figure locations/sizes to make everything flow

CV encoding of quantum information
	teleportation
	QKD
	QC

Relativistic effects in satellites (Dowling, Byrnes)

Add index{} to
	all figures
	all equations
	all tables
	all algorithms

Numbering of tables: reset counters appropriately

Check index for duplicates
Be consistent in use of singular and plural in index

How many switches do the paths in the generalised multi-to-multi switch pass through?

Information
	bits lost = bits - mutual information
	multiple channels:
		upper bound on bits lost is given by sum
		lower bound given by maximum number of bits lost, maximised over all channels

Remove ideas and suggestions

Talk about strategic adversaries (governments or companies) competing for computational power. They are both better of uniting resources, and homo/BQC mitigates the security concerns.

Discuss other cluster state preparation strategies
	Ladder
	Simon Benjamin schemes
	Just in time preparation (Kok)

Is thermal state dephased coherent state?

Any results out there on performance of different strategies?

Explain how NS gates make CZ gate work -> MZ interference, 2-photon component only undergoes phase-shift

how to model entanglement purification as a cost/attribute in the graph
	negative costs
	but consumes states
	what graph algorithms accommodate this?

Quantum supremacy: update boson-sampling extrapolation, or shift to another model, e.g universal

outsourced QC -> outsourced QIP protocols
	outsourced quantum experiments

Squeezing operator is defined in multiple places

Hybrid schemes particularly well suited to distributed model

MZ vs HOM interference
	only need latter for hybrid
	Need former for KLM
	Only need latter for cluster states with fusion gates.
	HOM is more desirable than MZ since it is far less demanding
	MZ stability is challenging in a distributed context over long distances
		even small temperature oscillations can screw us up
	whereas HOM stability is much more reasonable.
	HOM is sufficient for:
		fusion gates
		which-path erasure
			entanglement purification
			hybrid scheme entanglement

Chronologically order histories in tables

Section: certificates for user identification

how to decide how to split up quantum data across packets
	we treat packets monolitically
	how do we choose what part of a message goes into what packet?

implications for scientific research - outsource experiments and hide them

secrecy of quantum experiment conducted by academics, not just computation

Any other encryption protocols worth discussing?

quantum economic leverage provides profit incentive to voluntarily contribute quantum computational resources to the global network, to the benefit of all users, including themselves.

update statement of contributions - everyone should be there, anyone shouldn’t?
	remove Sam Marks from statement of contributions??

in ‘random number generation’
	talk about private key generation
	exception: don’t really want to outsource this since it needs to be kept private

owing to the fundamentally different scaling characteristics of the computational power of networked quantum computers compared to classical ones, economic models for their use are entirely different. we construct pricing models for the licensing of networked quantum computational resources, and discuss their economic implications.

interesting strategic implications: china and US better of combining forces, even though they are competing against each other and combining forces will strengthen the other

	error propagation and scaling - how do errors prop. under ent. swapping?
	single photon Bell pairs
	CV entangled states
		tradeoff between loss and dephasing
			large coherent amplitude = easier to detect, but more dephasing
			small coherent amplitude = harder to detect, easier to lose, less dephasing
	trust issues
	any other advantages to repeater networks that i haven’t mentioned
	anything beyond Bell-pairs?
