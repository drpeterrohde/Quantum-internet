In economic models we use n for number of qubits. is this right, or should it include compute time. Or is that absorbed into def for n? Classical it’s linear. Is that right?

In lambda_i def. change to lambda_n. n_i->n

Deep learning

n^2 is not Grover. Replace with general polynomials n^p

Section on geostrategic politics. Who benefits the most from asymmetry?

In abstract: discuss benefits to humanity. Rich and poor alike benefit from leverage upon unifying resources or using cloud time-sharing.

If they’re all unified, need a central authority with jurisdiction over the entire global network. How will this politically?

Simplify all equations - especially in economics section

Conflicting variable names in economics section - make consistent

Fix up all economic formulas relying on L_t 

Quantum machine learning!!

In essay section, quote after every section.

Tax/subsidy plot. Add text boxes showing tax and subsidy regimes.

Index
	digital assets
	consistent use of singular and plural terms (all plural?)
	Make index refs single page, first appearance in section. Make consistent. Just first appearance of term, or all pages following in section?
	Check index for duplicates
	Add index{} to
		all figures
		all equations
		all tables
		all algorithms
		multi-page indexes
	any ‘sees’?
	new sections
	remove duplicates

Plots for economic models

Network growth size should be \approx not =

Forward contract in time-share, not just asset

If different users have different scaling functions, how does this affect the relative amount they are willing to pay for time shares? Stockmarket? 
	
Quantum radar

QKD
	Add B92 QKD protocol
	make different protocols different subsections/subsubs/paragraphs

Experimental summary of boson-sampling experiments.

Chronological ordering of things
	e.g cluster state prep in protocols section -> reverse lookup to intro section

Why is roi asymptote to 1 instead of higher?

Add Bill Munro LOQC stuff -> pillage from BS review

Fix link to Nielsen CS papers

What is the relation between P_guess and tr_dist? Include in encryption section.

Strengthen motivation at beginning of each section. How does this fit in with the big picture of the quantum internet?

What happens with costs/attributes when we do purification?

CV encoding of quantum information
	teleportation
	QKD
	QC

Relativistic effects in satellites (Dowling, Byrnes)

Information
	bits lost = bits - mutual information
	multiple channels:
		upper bound on bits lost is given by sum
		lower bound given by maximum number of bits lost, maximised over all channels

Discuss other cluster state preparation strategies
	Ladder
	Simon Benjamin schemes
	Just in time preparation (Kok)

Is thermal state dephased coherent state?

Any results out there on performance of different strategies?

Consistent use of caps in algs. e.g packets vs Packets

how to model entanglement purification as a cost/attribute in the graph
	negative costs
	but consumes states
	what graph algorithms accommodate this?

Space race:
	QKD
	entanglement swapping as part of repeater network
	fusing remote cluster states with no direct line of communication

Quantum supremacy: update boson-sampling extrapolation, or shift to another model, e.g universal

Squeezing operator is defined in multiple places

Li, Benjamin - 1204.0443

Chronologically order histories in tables

Section: certificates for user identification

how to decide how to split up quantum data across packets
	we treat packets monolithically
	how do we choose what part of a message goes into what packet?

in ‘random number generation’
	talk about private key generation
	exception: don’t really want to outsource this since it needs to be kept private

3-level gradient echo memory

fig for crossover point for singularity

double check all algs

one-time-pad to box

add trace distance as metric
	how does it work for processes rather than states?

in quantum reps/ent dist, discuss:
	architectures
	resource scaling
	different strategies
	error propagation and scaling - how do errors prop. under ent. swapping?
	single photon Bell pairs
	CV entangled states
		tradeoff between loss and dephasing
			large coherent amplitude = easier to detect, but more dephasing
			small coherent amplitude = harder to detect, easier to lose, less dephasing
	trust issues
	any other advantages to repeater networks that i haven’t mentioned
	anything beyond Bell-pairs?

put QST and QPT into boxes

composition of squeezing operator

add fidelity and purity as cost metrics - how to convert?

quantum dot sources/detectors

Cartoons?

any more figures to add?

Quantum torrents???!

Add description of physical layer in stack

QEC in QOS
	in a repeater network, add syndrome measurement at each node

Rules for updating costs and attributes under action
	QEC
	entanglement purification

section: the next space race
	discuss USTC satellite

Section on timing and synchronisation. How does this affect strategies? How to model the constraints. (cite Wehner?? http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02565)
