Multiplexed number-resolved detection

Economics
	Risk/return tradeoffs.
	Market capitalisation of vendors of quantum hardware. This includes both manufacturers/sellers and also licensors of hardware (ask Sam Marks).
	Observation: only those hardware owners who unite with the global network will benefit from its leverage. Those who choose not to participate in the global network will be priced out of the market via exponentially higher cost per FLOP (assuming all other costs are equal).
	From our understanding of quantum stock-market dynamics, can we construct derivative markets? e.g futures, get/put options etc etc etc on units of compute time. A Quantum Black-Scholes perhaps?
	what about inefficient markets?
	suppose we assume a profit margin rather than zero profit efficiency assumption?

Indexing of new sections

In economic models we use n for number of qubits. is this right, or should it include compute time. Or is that absorbed into def for n? Classical it’s linear. Is that right?

Deep learning

n^2 is not Grover. Replace with general polynomials n^p

In abstract: discuss benefits to humanity. Rich and poor alike benefit from leverage upon unifying resources or using cloud time-sharing.

Quantum machine learning!!

Move economics summary to beginning of section

Intuitive interpretation of ent purification - prob of projecting into correct subspace

\section{The end of the digital revolution}
	* replacement of digital technology. QC is universal for classical comp. When qubits become as cheap as classical bits, classical computers will become redundant and we expect a full transition of the digital economy to quantum architectures.

Singularity - subsections
	* self improvement via optimisation of network resource allocation
	* self improvement of hardware architectures via IC layout algorithms being NP-complete
	* in end-of-digital-revolution world, most end-user applications will be classical not quantum. The excess unused quantum resources held by users the world over, will then be contributed to the network, ushering in unprecedented growth in the scale and computational leverage of the network.
	* machine learning - discovery of new algorithms, applications and architectures, self-improvement.

Plot legends - shift into white space within frame

3-level gradient echo memory

fig for crossover point for singularity

double check all algs

	resource scaling
	different strategies
	error propagation and scaling - how do errors prop. under ent. swapping?
	single photon Bell pairs

			small coherent amplitude = harder to detect, easier to lose, less dephasing

	anything beyond Bell-pairs?
