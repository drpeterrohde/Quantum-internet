OLD ABSTRACT:

The desire to share and unite remote digital assets motivated the development of the classical internet. As we enter the quantum era, it is to be expected that there will be a similar demand for quantum assets, motivating a \textit{global quantum internet}. Large ad hoc networks require well-constructed protocols to efficiently and reliably facilitate communication between arbitrary distant parties. We discuss quantum networking, and introduce the Quantum Transmission Control Protocol (QTCP) -- an extension of the classical TCP/IP protocol stack -- its operation and implementation, including a presentation of the low-level algorithms underpinning it, and consider its application to various quantum protocols to which networking will foreseeably be applied in the near future. This will enable future quantum networks to communicate quantum resources, implement full global networking services, and enable new models for the commercialisation and proliferation of quantum technologies. In particular, we examine \textit{cloud quantum computing}, whereby clients can license compute time on a host's quantum computer to process their data in the cloud. This is of great importance for the widespread adoption of quantum computing -- given their high expected initial cost a client/server model for outsourced quantum computation will be essential to enabling accessibility. Combined with protocols for encrypted quantum computation, the client/server model can ensure secrecy of data and algorithms. Entanglement distribution is a primitive resource with widespread applications in quantum protocols, and we discuss quantum repeater networks, which specialise in this single task. As the scaling in the computational power of quantum computers is fundamentally different to classical computing, it is to be expected the economics of networked quantum computers will also be. We discuss the economic implications of networked quantum computers, and arrive at the conclusion that future quantum computers around the globe will all be networked, pooling their computational resources to form a \textit{global virtual quantum computer} with exponentially more power than that possessed by individual market participants. The optimal economic model for all users, large or small, is to contribute their resources to the network and time-share the net computational power -- a fundamentally different conclusion than for classical computers. We also provide a review of the current state of the art in quantum technologies. Finally we present a non-technical discussion of the implications of the quantum internet, and a vision for its future. While this work is only an early step in a rapidly developing field, still in its infancy, the central concepts we present will be highly relevant to future developments. This work is targeted very broadly at quantum and classical computer scientists, classical computer systems, software and network engineers, physicists, and those generally curious about the future of quantum technologies.
