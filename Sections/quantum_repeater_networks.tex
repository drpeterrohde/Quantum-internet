\section{Quantum repeater networks} \label{sec:rep_net} \index{Quantum repeater networks}

\textit{Quantum repeaters} are devices that allow entanglement to be shared between distant nodes, when no direct line of communication is available from a server to its two clients. This is achieved using a bootstrapped entanglement swapping protocol (Sec.~\ref{sec:swapping}). Most commonly, this entanglement is in the form of Bell-pairs, which, as discussed previously in Sec.~\ref{sec:ent_ultimate}, form a ubiquitous resource for many essential quantum protocols. The actual physical encoding of the entangled states may vary, but is most commonly in the form of polarisation-encoded single-photons or CV states.
