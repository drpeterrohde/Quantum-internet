\comment{Note that when performing a brute-force attack against a private encryption key\index{Private-key encryption}, a quadratic speedup effectively halves the key length in terms of algorithmic runtime. Thus, in the quantum era private key lengths will need to be doubled.}

\comment{Shift discussion of halving private keylength by half from footnote in early section.}
