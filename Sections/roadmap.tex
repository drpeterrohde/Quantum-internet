\dropcap{W}{e} have in this work presented a vast number of ideas, protocols, applications and implications for future quantum technology, mediated by the quantum internet. The relationship between all these concepts is highly complex, with a large number of interdependencies. In Fig.~\ref{fig:roadmap} we summarise this via a mind-map\index{Mind-map}, capturing these relationships to show the logical flow of developments that will need to take place to reach various technological destinations.
