Peter Rohde is an ARC Future Fellow in the Centre for Quantum Software \& Information at the University of Technology Sydney, Australia (UTS:Q$|$SI$\rangle$), and associate member of the Hearne Institute for Theoretical Physics at Louisiana State University. He obtained a Bachelor of Computer Systems Engineering with First Class Honours, and a PhD in theoretical physics at the University of Queensland. He has worked at highly-acclaimed international institutes, including the University of Oxford, University of Queensland, Institute for Molecular Biosciences and Max-Planck Institute for the Science of Light, with over 50 publications and 1,300+ citations in quantum optics, quantum computing, quantum information theory and ecology. His theoretical proposals have inspired several world-leading experimental efforts, including time-bin encoded \textsc{BosonSampling} and sub-shot-noise limited quantum metrology. In his spare time he is a musician, composer, public speaker, charity worker, mountaineer and adrenaline junkie. He regularly speaks at prominent scientific outreach events, features in newspaper and magazine articles, and conducts radio interviews. He is a very naughty boy and was expelled from preschool.
